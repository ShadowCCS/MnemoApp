## 🚀 What is Mnemo?

Mnemo is a **fully modular**, cross-platform learning platform powered by **Avalonia 11** and **.NET 8**.  
It combines flashcards, notes, mindmaps, learning paths, games, and more, all in one place.  

> No subscriptions. No ads. No tracking. Ever.

We’ve built Mnemo to be:

- **Extensible** – Every feature is an extension (even the core app) thanks to MnemoAPI  
- **Customizable** – Theme & language system with full localization support. Adjust everything from fonts, colors, font size and more.
- **Cross-platform** – Windows, macOS, and Linux  
- **Accessible** – Features designed with inclusivity in mind
